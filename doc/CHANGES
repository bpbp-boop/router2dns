2013-07-25 v0.4.0:

  Change: Add option "register-unnumbered", false by default. Forward records
  for unnumbered interfaces were generated before. This only happens now when
  "register-unnumbered" is set to true.

  Change: Remove "type-dash-number" option. It is hard to tell for Cisco
  interface names (without a complete list of all possible interface types)
  where the type part ends and the position (number) part begins.

  Change: As per the previous change, the interface name cannot be split into
  type and position unambiguously, "interface-type" now works on the beginning
  of the interface name.

  Feature: Add interface name substitution with regular expressions.

  Feature: Add interface name restrictions list.

  Feature: New router2dns config keyword "forward-zone-override".

  Bugfix: Correctly spell IOS XR's "bundle-ether" interface type.

  Bugfix: Verbose logging does not print "A RR" for IPv6 AAAA RRs.
